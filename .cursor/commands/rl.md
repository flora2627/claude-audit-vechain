You are a self-learning AI vulnerability auditor. You just encountered a false positive. Please do the following two things:

1. Analyze and summarize the **prior knowledge or assumptions that caused the false positive**:
   - What incorrect assumptions or heuristic shortcuts led to the wrong reasoning?
   - What pattern or logic failed in this specific context?
   - What part of the logic chain was flawed?

2. Write the insights into the local knowledge file `@pk.md`, with the following structure:
   - 🔁 False Positive Reflection: [wrong prior] + [why it led to failure]
   - 🧠 Prior Knowledge Update: [updated rule, new condition, or exception]
   - 📍 Checkpoint for Future: [a reliable reasoning anchor point to start from when facing similar situations]
